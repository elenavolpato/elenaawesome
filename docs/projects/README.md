## meditation timer app

I made this meditations timer app and wrote about it [here.](https://www.elenavolpato.me/2021/04/27/its-here/) This gave me a lot of confidence as front end developer and also a lot of fun!

This project is a weekly web dev challenge from [scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) is a quiz maker. The challenge itself was to make a simple quiz, and validate answers. However, I took it a bit further and made 2 themes for you to choose from.

This was very interesting to do, because it was the first time a used router, which increased greatly the complexity of my projects.
