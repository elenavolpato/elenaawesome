summary: How I procrastinate real development learning with CSS testing
---
The Elena b.D.(before Development ðŸ˜‚) was a project manager for presentations and corporate events. I mean PowerPoint presentations and thousands and thousands of slides. Most of the companies came to us for the design, they were looking for a beautiful presentation with the "wow" factor. And, I was resposible for briefings, reviews and overall feedback of the design - and I also did some stuff myself.

Now, as a developer I haven't been able to turn off this visual thing connected to design. So, when I start I new project, like the [meditation timer](https://meditate.elenavolpato.me/) , I can't wait to go into CSS and start making it beautiful. And that is great, right? **WROOONG**

When I start thinking about the design, I postpone other real bugs and keep on changing, and changing, and trying new things in CSS. And I believe that's also because the results are right there to be seen and I keep trying to understand why something ain't working, and then I come upon something new, and want to change everything again and again. And there goes hours, and hours of work. In the [meditation timer](https://meditate.elenavolpato.me/) project I started using [tailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), so there were even more hours spent on learning this new framework. 

Although having a beautiful app is nice, I don't believe this should be a priority when starting the development. If something doesn't work properly, what use can its design and beauty have?

So, my strategy to deal with that is: **first** solve all basic logic and functionalities of an app, while ignoring the design (an this is very hard to do). And when things are actually working, I start working on the design ans testing.
