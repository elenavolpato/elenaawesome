summary: The meditation timer app is finally here!
---
After over 2 weeks working on the app, it finally has the basic features I planned for it! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ  

I'm soooo excited to be realeasing this! I learned a lot from writing this and also made a lot of mistakes along the way - obviously. 

The idea was to build a meditation timer and I focused first on three features that bothered me in other apps:
**1. The sound of the Tibetan bell:** sometimes it wasn't a soothing sound. So I picked 3 different ones for the user to choose from.
**2. Reminders:** sometimes, I just wanted to meditate in silence and have some bells along the way to be a reminder when you're minf wandering - similar to experiences I had meditating in Yoga classes. So, there is an option to add up to 10 reminders during the meditation. 
**3. Ending bell:** some guided meditations end with someone saying "thank you" or "good job" and others it has just one bell. Since I put the feature of reminders, the final bell plays three times, so the user can tell the difference it has ended.

And then, I spent a lot of time customizing (and learning how to use) it with [tailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) , asking friends and family to test it and fixing things. 

It was a lot of fun, and I'm starting to really feel like a developer.

Hope you enjoy the app!
