summary: Issues and bugs that became the priority in the meditation timer app
---

After releasing the first usable version of the meditation timer app with its basic features, I had already established some stretch goals described in the about of the app. But as I started using it, I realized some other features that needed work. Such as:

1. when using any browser in any smart phone, it will eventually turn off the screen and the bells will not be heard (unless you have any kind of extensions that allow you to continue listening any audio while the screen is off or you changed the app). So I had to discover how to keep the screen on or how to override systems configs.
    **This is a rather important issue that makes the app not functional**
2. make it available off-line. It is such a simple app that it makes no sense to have access to internet connection to be able to use it. So, make it off-line was also a priority.
