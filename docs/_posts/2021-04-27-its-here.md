### you never forget the first app
I'm soooo excited to be realeasing this! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ I learned a lot from it and also made a lot of mistakes along the way - obviously. 
And after two weeks working on this app, it finally has the basic features I planned for it! 

<div class="mdButtons"><a href="https://meditate.elenavolpato.me/"> Go to app </a></div>

I built it from a blank project, and everything you see there was chosen and worked on carefully - no templates (only the background animation is from another developer/designer [Dave DeSandro](https://desandro.com/)). 

The idea was to build a customizable meditation timer: I focused first on three features that bothered me in other apps:

1. **The sound of the Tibetan bell:** sometimes it wasn't a soothing sound. So I picked 3 different ones for the meditator to choose from.

2. **Reminders:** sometimes, I just wanted to meditate in silence and have some bells along the way to be a reminder when you're mind wandering - something similar to experiences I had meditating in Yoga classes. So, there is an option to add up to 10 reminders during a meditation. 

3. **Ending bell:** some other timed meditation apps just end it by playing one bell. With the reminder feature, the ending bell had to be different. So, it is played three times in the end of a meditation session.

After putting these features to work, I spent a lot of time (and also postponing to finish the working/logic part) customizing it with [tailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), asking friends and family to test it, fixing bugs and fine-tuning responsiveness. It was a lot of fun, and I'm starting to really feel like a developer. ðŸ˜Ž

### a bunch of thanks
Thanks to Elisa, Beiro, Denis and Vini - the family and friends who put up with the testing, my odd excitement and gave amazing suggestions.
And the most special thanks to Edgar, who listened to the most deviant questions, helped me come up with solutions and still has so much patience with my learning. ðŸ’œ

Hope you enjoy the app!
