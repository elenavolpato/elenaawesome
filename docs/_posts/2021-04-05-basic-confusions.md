summary: All this began because of "software framework"

## Software framework, the confusing 
Since I started learning to code I haven't been able to find a simple explanation to this concept - maybe that's because, concepts in programming are rarely simple and have codependent concepts to be understood. Explanations, like this one from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework) for software framework:   

> _In computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software._

Then, I got to some theoretical explanations that got me digging about [high- and low-level operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-_and_low-level), [difference between a library and a framework](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library-bd133054023f/), Inversion of Control (good knowledge to have, but not the way to go for a practical understanding). So I stopped, scraped all of that (literally - I had a bunch of text written and realized it was going nowhere) and started over. 

## Web framework, the understandable
And then, when I searched for "web framework". It felt like light at the end of a tunnel: 

> _A web framework (WF) or web application framework (WAF) is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs. Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications on the World Wide Web._ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework)

I decided to ignore the terms "web resources, services and APIs" and focus on the last sentence, the one that really explained it all to me: **"a standard way to build and deploy web applications".** From this, I understood that learning a framework such as [Vue](https://vuejs.org) - the one behind elenavolpato.me - is like learning the correct way to fill the blanks, and make it work for my needs. An, in despite of the "standard" sounding very restictive, I've been able to personalize it as I wish and learn a lot from its possibilities.



## Where I researched 
These pages below are the one I visited in order to understand a framework. Some made me even more confused, but when put all together, it all helped me understand a web framework.

<!-- 
After doing some research about frameworks and came to three concepts that have to be explained before you can understand what a framework is - if you are already familiar with any of them, feel free to skip it or give me some suggestions on how to improve these explanations üòâ:
* software libraries
* high level and low level operations
* the languages in which the code is written

### Software libraries

It is pretty much like a traditional library, the ones that hold books written by someone else. "A software library generally consists of pre-written code, classes, procedures, scripts, configuration data and more." [Technopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3828/software-library)

### High- and low-level operations

In [Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-_and_low-level) _high-level describe those operations that are more abstract in nature._ And _Low-level describes more specific individual components of a systematic operation, focusing on the details of rudimentary micro functions rather than macro, complex processes._

Ok. But no, I did not understand it yet.  

An example might help: in Biology there are many levels of organizations, from smallest to largest, they are: molecule, cell, tissue, organ, organ system and organism. So you can say that molecules and cells take care of low level operations, and the others of higher levels of operations, more abstract and complex ones.

The same happens in software development. But where? How? We'll get to that.

### Languages

There are hundreds(even thousands) of programming languages that were created since de 1800 (on this  page you can find a very interesting list of programming languages organized alphabetically, chronologically and other options).

Basically, a programming language tells the computer what it should do. Every programming language has a syntax and a particular set of rules, which need to be followed every time the code is written. A software framework is built on top of a programming language.


## Framework
The [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/framework) defines framework as **"a supporting structure around which something can be built".** 

Using the three concepts presented and the definition above, a framework is a sort of shortcut to programming: it uses a programming language, and takes care of low-level operations (most of them)  leaving the high level thinking to you. It's like a set of rules to follow that enables you to learn to code and write code faster.

#### And what about the library?

Both libraries and frameworks are reusable code written by someone else.
In many ways a framework is similar to a library, the difference is how each of them uses this pre-written code. A framework has a structure (a frame of work üòÖ) and you have to "fill in the blanks" accordingly so whatever you are making works. A library is more flexible, which can give you more possibilities, but to make it work you have to do almost everything from scratch.

On this link from [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library-bd133054023f/) you can see an technical example of coding with a library (jQuery) and with a framework (Vue).

[React](https://reactjs.org/), [Angular](https://angularjs.org) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org) are front-end web frameworks built on top of the JavaScript programming language. And [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) and [Flask](https://pythonbasics.org/what-is-flask-python/) are two different web frameworks built on top of the Python programming language. Hence, they are also known as Python frameworks.-->
