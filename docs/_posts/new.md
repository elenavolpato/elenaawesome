summary: Trying to do one kata per day

It's been a while since I posted anything here because now I'm Berlin for the Summer, and the traveling and getting settled was kinda chaotic - I had to leave my beloved dogs 🐕🐕 back in Brazil and I miss them daily 😢, get Covid testing and everything else that traveling in these times requires.

Anyway, last week I participated on online event: the HackEvenings for Women Who Code Berlin. It was really fun to meet other women who already are developers for sometime and some others that are also new to this like me. The big thing I discovered there was the kata challenges; According to [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/), ["kata are code challenges focused on improving skill and technique."](https://docs.codewars.com/concepts/kata/)

By the way, [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/) is another discovery from last week's event, and I'm using it as my source of new challenges!
So here is my solution my first kata! 

You were given a width and a length of a rectangle. The challenge was to build a code that would provide a list with the minimum amount of squares that are possible inside this rectangle. More information about the challenge [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55466989aeecab5aac00003e/).
