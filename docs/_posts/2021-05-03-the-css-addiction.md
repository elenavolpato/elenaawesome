summary: How I procrastinate real development learning with CSS testing
---
The Elena b.D.(before Development ðŸ˜‚) was a project manager for presentations and corporate events. I mean PowerPoint presentations and thousands and thousands of slides. Most of the companies came to us for the design, they were looking for a beautiful presentation with the "wow" factor. And I was responsible for briefings, reviews and overall feedback of the design - and I also did some stuff myself.

Now, as a developer I haven't been able to turn off this visual thing connected to design. So, when I start I new project, like the [meditation timer](https://meditate.elenavolpato.me/), I can't wait to go into CSS and start making it beautiful. And that is great, right? 

**WROOONG**

When I start thinking about the design, I postpone other real bugs and keep on changing, and changing, and trying new things in CSS. And I believe that's also because the results are right there to be seen and I keep trying to understand why something ain't working, and then I come upon something new, and want to change everything again and again. And too many hours of work are spent on this. To make things worse, in the [meditation timer](https://meditate.elenavolpato.me/) I started using [tailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), so there were even **more hours spent** on learning this new framework (I'm loving tailwindCSS btw).

Although having a beautiful app is nice, as a developer, I don't believe this should be a priority when starting a project. Because if something doesn't work properly, what use can its design and beauty have?

<video controls autoplay loop width="100%">git log
  <source src="/assets/img/meditate.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

So, my strategy to deal with that is: **first solve all basic logic and functionalities of an app, while ignoring the design.** For the meditation timer this meant making all the bells play and pause, make the time range work, build the reminder bells logic, make the timer work on the meditation page with the selected customization.

And when things are working after some of my own tests, I started working on the design and do some testing with friends and family. After that came bugs and I started to see endless improvements which I'm still working on - and enjoying it!
