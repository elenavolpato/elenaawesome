## From a meditation journey...

For over an year I've been meditating regularly - not everyday as I supposed to, but quite often. It has helped to cope with some struggles: changing my career completely, the end of a long term relationship, moving to another city, the death of a loved one, and the Covid-19 pandemic. And, yeah. It all happened in 2020. So meditation has helped keep my head in place. 

To start meditating I searched for some meditation apps. I started with [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com). I did their courses on axiety and happiness, used the daily meditations and really enjoyed it for a long time. But, as I gained confidence, the over explanatory method from Headspace started to bother me. 

Then, I decided to meditate without any apps. That definitively did not work. I wasn't able to build an habit without something to keep track.

After that, I tried [Atom](https://www.theatom.app/). I loved this one! The voice of the man guiding you is so sothing, it's content is very well written and fun, and it has an interesting gamification feature with points that allow you to plant a tree at the end of each meditation. The problem is it's focused on meditation for beginners, and on creating habits. So, when you finish the program of twenty something days, it is over. There are no options to continue using the app unless you start over and do it all over again. 

They do suggest other free meditation apps, such as [Plum Village](https://plumvillage.app/),the one I've been using andt has excellent guided meditations and solved the over explanation dilema I was having with Headspace. But I still would like other personalizations for a silent meditation, such as: choosing the bell sound, to be able to put interval bells, have a white-noise on the background, and, most importantly, save the ammount of time I have meditated being counted as in Headspace app.

## ...to a meditation app

So, this week I started working on a meditation timer app with some of the features I listed above. I've been using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org) for this. So far, the differences between Vue 2 and 3 have been easy to come around and I am practicing v-for and v-model with this app. It's been really fun and challenging. I hope to release something in the next couple of weeks. Stay tuned! ðŸ˜†

#### Other resources I have used:
[Calm](https://www.calm.com)    
[Meditate timer](https://meditation-timer.link/) - This one is actually an open source PWA(Progressive Web App) by [benji6](https://github.com/benji6/meditation-timer) and uses [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and very easy to use. I  also used this one as an inpiration for my own app.

I also have been reading [_The mind Illuminated_](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Illuminated-Meditation-Integrating-Mindfulness/dp/1501156985) book by John Yates, an amazing guide on meditation! If you are interested in this subject, I suggest you start with this book and the Atom app.
