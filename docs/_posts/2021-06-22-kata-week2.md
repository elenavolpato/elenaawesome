summary: 'New week: challenge updated'
---

The first week of myself imposed challenge is over. And I failed. ðŸ˜ž The heat here was too intense - over 36 degrees in some days - and it was overwhelming to stay at home and work. So we went to the park to enjoy the end of the day breeze, and in the weekend we went to a lake.

However, this week started great! I already did two katas, and after finishing them, I worked on some improvements - with the most important help from Edgar, the fiancÃ©. ðŸ’œ

#### Monday Kata - week 2
The first Kata was to sum all the digits in a number until it becomes only one digit, this one [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/541c8630095125aba6000c00). 

``` javascript
function sumDigits(n) {
	let totalSum = 0;
  while (n > 9) {
    let nDigit = n % 10
    let nPart = Math.floor(n / 10);
    totalSum = totalSum + nDigit;
    n = nPart;    	
  }
  totalSum = totalSum + n; 
  return totalSum;
}

function digital_root(n) {
	let res = n
	while (true) {
  	res = sumDigits(res)
    if (res< 10) {
    	break
    }
  }
  return res
}
```

After finishing, I started looking at other peoples solutions in [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/), and found one solution that is only one line of code! ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜² They use some math theories apparently.

#### Tuesday Kata
After that, I did one about calculating the number of people in a bus (you can see the challenge [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5648b12ce68d9daa6b000099)). And my initial code, was this:

``` javascript
var number = function(busStops){
  let busStopsLen = busStops.length;
  let busStatus = busStops[0][0] - busStops[0][1];
  for (let i = 1; i < busStopsLen; i++) {
    busStatus = busStatus + (busStops[i][0] - busStops[i][1]);    
  }
  return busStatus
}
```

Then, after talking to Edgar about it, he helped me to make it even simpler, using the `.reduce()` method. And it became this:

``` javascript
var number = function(busStops){
  return busStops.reduce((a,b) => a + b[0]-b[1], 0);
}
```

Even though I didn't manage to do all the katas from last week, it has been great to do this! I'm learning how to use different methods, not just `while`, `if else` and `for`, and new ways of thinking. Also rewriting the code in a more concise manner has also helped understand it deeply. 

To make the challenge more possible, and less frustrating, this week I'll ~~try to~~ do at least five katas, not seven. Only 3 more to go! Wish me luck!
