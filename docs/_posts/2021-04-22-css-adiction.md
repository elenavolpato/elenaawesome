summary: It's here! The meditation timer is finally here!

After over 2 weeks working on the app, it finally has the basic features I planned for it! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ 
I'm soooo excited to be realeasing this! I learned a lot from writing this and also made a lot of mistakes along the way - obviously. 

The idea was to build a meditation timer and I focused first on three features that bothered me in other apps:
1. The sound of the Tibetan bell: sometimes it wasn't a soothing sound. So I picked 3 different ones for the user to choose from.
2. Reminders: sometimes, I just wanted to meditate in silence and have some bells along the way - similar to experiences I had meditating in a Yoga class. So, there is an option to add up to 10 reminders during the meditation. 
3. Ending bell: some guided meditations end with someone saying "thank you" or "good job" and other was just one bell. Since I put the feature of reminders, the final bell plays three times, so the user really knows it has ended.

And then, I spent a lot of time customizing it with [tailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), asking friends and family to test it and fixing things.

Hope you enjoy the app!
