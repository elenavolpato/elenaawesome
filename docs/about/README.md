# about me
I’m 30 something years old, living in Brazil, trying to move somewhere else, and learning how to code.

I worked for almost 10 years in marketing, and events. On late 2019 I decided to quit my job and become a dog trainer. Then, 2020 hit us with the pandemic and plans changed. I moved from São Paulo to a small town in the countryside of Minas Gerais. With the help of some experienced people (my boyfriend and another friend), I decided to really pursue a programming career. 

My boyfriend, a great friend and I have a ongoing project together, in which I’m responsible for bench-marking, wireframes, communication and some user testing. Since they are way more experienced in coding then I am, for now I’m doing all the “boring” work of organizing things lol. This project is a offline first self organizing tool and we hope to have something to be release by July 2021.

I am also studying on a daily basis something related to programming. Such as: JavaScript, Vue, HTML, CSS, SQL and so on. I'm using some different online free courses to learn: [scrimba](https://scrimba.com/), [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) and some regular search about specifics topics on duckduckgo.
