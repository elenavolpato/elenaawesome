# about me

After over 8 years working as a project manager for corporate events and presentations, in 2020 I decided to change my career completely. I wanted to become a dog trainer, had started studying it and was applying for some companies to work with it. But then, the corona pandemic started and my plans had to change. Then, I turned to a old curiosity I had in programming, and with the help of some friends and my fianc√© I started studying Javascript, HTML, CSS and Vue.js. 

I am constantly learning new things and I write about it in this page website. You can also check my meditation app [here](https://meditate.elenavolpato.me/).

I'm currently living in Europe, working on some personal projects and looking for remote job opportunities as a frontend developer.
