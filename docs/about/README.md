# about me
I am 33 years old front end developer living in Brazil. My skills are strategic  planning, problem  solving, process implementation and improvement.  I'm also skilled in HTML, CSS, javascript, vue.js, tailwindCSS, some SQÃ‡ and some Python. And I am constantly learning new things and I write about it in this page. ðŸ˜Ž

I worked for almost 10 years in marketing, and events. In late 2019 I decided to quit my job and become a dog trainer. Then, 2020 hit us with the pandemic and plans changed. I moved from SÃ£o Paulo to a small town in the countryside of Minas Gerais. With the help of some experienced people I decided to really pursue a programming career.
