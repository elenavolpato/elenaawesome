My latest project (besides this website) is a weekly web dev challenge from [scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) is a quiz maker. The challenge itself was to make a simple quiz, and validate answers. however, I took it a bit further and made 2 theme for you to choose from and a way for you to make your own quizes. You can check it out here.

This was very interesting to do, because it was the first time a used router, which increased greatly the complexity of my projects.
